## Example usage

Note, this example is not runnable - it is merely a snippet of a larger React Typescript app demonstrating how you can use the game definitions to render, validate and score editable forms.

`Questions.tsx` defines rendering of two kinds of question, numerical and categorical.

`ScoreCalculator.tsx` renders the full calculator for a given game, including validation, scoring and (basic) printing.

Styling is done using Material UI v4.
